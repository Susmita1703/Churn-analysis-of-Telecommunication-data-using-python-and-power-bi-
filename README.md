## Objective 🎯
The main objective of this project is to generate effective insights that help understand the complete narrative and identify the reasons why customers stop taking services.

### Conducting data assessment, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python, followed by performing hypothesis testing to derive accurate conclusions. 

## [Uncleaned data 📂](https://github.com/Susmita1703/Churn-analysis-of-Telecommunication-data-using-python-and-power-bi-/blob/main/Telco-Customer-Churn-real-data.csv)

I have identified 0.15% missing values in the dataset and filled them using the KNN imputer for a more accurate analysis.

## Prepare a dashboard in Power BI to visualize and understand the data in a more interactive way. 📈

## Conclusion 📌
Customers who pay high monthly charges are more likely to leave, which could be a significant reason for churn.

Monthly customers are more likely to churn due to the lack of contract terms, as they have the freedom to leave at any time.

Customers without online security or tech support are high churners.

Total charges of customers account for almost 18% of the churn rate, making it crucial to understand the patterns and reasons to better manage future customers.
